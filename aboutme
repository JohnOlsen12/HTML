    <p class="p"> Hi, My name is John. I am a sophomore at Piedmont High school an I live in Piedmont, California. I moved to Piedmont in 7th grade from Oakland and started Piedmont schools in the 8th Grade. I like playing baseball and hanging out with my friends. The picture I chose is from a small lake in Tahoe, I love tahoe especially skiing and spending time up there with friends.</p>
